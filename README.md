# WhatsTheWeatherLike
For this project, Python was used to create a script to visualize the weather of 500+ cities across the world of varying distance from the equator.


# Analysis
  - As expected, the weather becomes significantly warmer as one approaches the equator (0 Deg. Latitude). More interestingly, however, is     the fact that the southern hemisphere tends to be warmer this time of year than the northern hemisphere. This may be due to the tilt       of the earth.
  - There is no strong relationship between latitude and cloudiness, however, it is interesting to see that a strong band of cities sits       at 0, 80, and 100% cloudiness.
  - There is no strong relationship between latitude and wind speed, however in northern hemispheres there is a flurry of cities with over     20 mph of wind.


# Resources and API Datasets
To accomplish the project https://pypi.org/project/citipy/ - citipy and https://openweathermap.org/ - OpenWeatherMap  was utilized.
